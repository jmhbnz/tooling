This document captures my standard tooling for future replication and aims to make it as easy as possible to setup and use.

The environment is based on Windows 10 using [[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/announcing-wsl-2/][Windows Subsystem for Linux 2]] for a [[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] based command line development interface.

For an editor I rely on [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]], specifically [[https://github.com/humacs/humacs][humacs]]. To pair and share my terminals with others I rely on [[https://tmate.io/][tmate]].

This documentation is split into two main sections:
 - [[windows-setup.org][Windows 10 Config]]
 - [[wsl-setup.org][Ubuntu Config]]
