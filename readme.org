This document captures my standard development environment for future replication
and aims to make it as easy as possible to setup and use.

The environment is based on Windows 10 using [[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/announcing-wsl-2/][Windows Subsystem for Linux 2]] for a
command line development interface.

For development I rely on [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]], specifically [[https://github.com/humacs/humacs][humacs]]. To pair and share my terminals with others I rely on [[https://tmate.io/][tmate]].

This documentation is split into two main sections:
 - [[windows-setup.org][Windows 10 Config]]
 - [[wsl-setup.org][Windows Subsystem for Linux Config]]
