This document captures my standard tooling for future replication and aims to make it as easy as possible to setup and use.

The environment is based on [[https://linuxmint.com/][Linux Mint]] ~20.3~ primarily, although guides for Windows 11 with [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about][Window Subsystem for Linux]] are included from a legacy perspective.


* How I get things done

Before diving into the technical details, below is a brief summary of how I get things done.

** Code editing

For an editor I primarily rely on [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]], specifically [[https://github.com/humacs/humacs][humacs]]. To pair and share my terminals with others I rely on [[https://tmate.io/][tmate]].

The main feature that I rely on in emacs is [[https://orgmode.org/][~org-mode~]].



** Browsing the web
