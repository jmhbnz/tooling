This guide will walk through how I setup fresh installations of [[https://pop.system76.com/][POP!_OS]]. Pop!_OS is a free and open-source Linux distribution, based upon Ubuntu, and featuring a customized GNOME desktop environment known as COSMIC. The distribution is developed by American Linux computer manufacturer System76. Pop!_OS is primarily built to be bundled with the computers built by System76, but can also be downloaded and installed on most computers.

Pop!_OS provides full out-of-the-box support for both AMD and Nvidia GPUs. It is regarded as an easy distribution to set up for gaming, mainly due to its built-in GPU support. Pop!_OS provides default disk encryption, streamlined window and workspace management, keyboard shortcuts for navigation as well as built-in power management profiles.

I use POP!_OS as my daily driver operating system on a variety of different machines. The intent of this guide is to make it easy for me to get back up and running quickly whenver I do a fresh installation.


* Setup home directory structure

After installing the distribution I ensure the following directories are present in my home folder as they are relied on by other automated steps in this setup process:

#+NAME: Setup home folder strucuture
#+begin_src shell
# Ensure we are in our home folder and create required directories
cd ~/ && mkdir Documents Downloads
#+end_src


* Install base packages

Now that we have our home directory done let's install the standard packages we use.

#+begin_src tmux
sudo apt install --yes btop nvtop screenfetch git curl wget xclip wl-clipboard xsel emacs xterm xtermcontrol jq tmux apt-transport-https dict gh unrar ripgrep
#+end_src

For working with container images locally outside of kubernetes clusters we use [[https://podman.io/][~podman~]] so that we can avoid the security problems of a standard docker daemon. Follow the steps below to install podman:

#+begin_src tmux
# Add the repositories to our apt sources
echo "deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/xUbuntu_20.04/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.list

# Add the repository key
curl -L "https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/xUbuntu_20.04/Release.key" | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt update && sudo apt --yes install podman
#+end_src


When working with kubernetes applications we often use [[https://helm.sh][helm]], let's download and install the latest release from github.

#+NAME: Install helm
#+BEGIN_src tmux
wget $(sed 's/.\{1\}$//' <<< $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/helm/helm/releases/latest | grep -oP 'https...get.helm.sh.helm-v\d+.\d+.\d+-linux-amd64.tar.gz[)]'))

tar xf helm*.tar.gz linux-amd64/helm --transform 's,linux-amd64,,' && rm -rf helm-*linux-amd64.tar.gz

sudo mv helm /usr/local/bin/helm
#+END_SRC


Finally, we should upgrade the python package manger ~pip~ that we installed, before using it to install [[https://github.com/containers/podman-compose][podman-compose]].

#+NAME: Upgrade pip
#+BEGIN_src tmux
sudo pip install --upgrade pip && sudo pip3 install podman-compose
#+END_SRC


For managing secrets we use [[https://bitwarden.com/][bitwarden]] which provides a great [[https://github.com/bitwarden/cli][cli utility]]. Additionally in our [[.bashrc][bashrc]] file included in this repository there are a number of helper functions to make working with ~bw~ easier.

#+NAME: Install bitwarden and login
#+begin_src tmux
# Download the latest release
wget "https://vault.bitwarden.com/download/?app=cli&platform=linux" --output-document "bw.zip"

# Unzip and install the latest release
unzip "bw.zip" && sudo install "bw" "/usr/local/bin" && rm "bw" "bw.zip"

# Login to bitwarden
bw login mail@jamesblair.net
#+end_src


For ad-hoc system administration we use [[https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x ][ansible]]. We install ansible via ~pip3~ to ensure any modules or additional packages required at a later date can be easily managed.

For significant ansible or python projects a virtual environment for python is suggested to keep project packages separate from system python packages.

#+NAME: Install ansible via pip
#+BEGIN_src tmux
pip3 install ansible
#+END_SRC


* Restore ssh keys and dotfiles

I make extensive use of ~.dotfiles~ to further customise my environment. The script below restores my versions of key dotfiles automatically.

*** Obtain ssh key from bitwarden

In order to be able to clone the repository in the next step we need to obtain our ssh keys from bitwarden. Given we have installed the bitwarden cli we can mostly automte this process minus the initial login to bitwarden.

#+NAME: Obtain ssh keys from bitwarden
#+begin_src shell
# Ensure we have an ssh-agent running
eval `ssh-agent`

# Generate a new blank key to overwrite
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/james -q -P ""

# Ensure we have an active bitwarden session
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw > ~/.bw_session && cat ~/.bw_session)

# Export both keys
export key=$(bw get item desktop --pretty | grep notes)

# Extract private key
export private=${key:12}
export private=${private/END RSA*/END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----}
echo $private | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n")}1' > ~/.ssh/james

# Extract public key
export public=${key/*ssh-rsa/ssh-rsa} && echo ${public::-2} | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n")}1' > ~/.ssh/james.pub
#+end_src


*** Clone and restore dotfiles

Once our keys are available to us we can clone down our dotfiles and get back to our comfortable normal terminal environment.

#+NAME: Clone and restore the dotfiles
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Clone down this repository
git clone https://jmhbnz@gitea.jamma.life/jmhbnz/tooling.git ~/Documents/tooling/

# Restore all dotfiles
cp ~/Documents/tooling/.* ~/

# Reload bashrc with updated version
source ~/.bashrc
#+END_SRC




* Optional configuration

** Optional - Cloud provider tools

Currently ~kubectl~ is packaged separately to ~gcloud~ and other cloud provider tools so let's install that first.

#+NAME: Install kubectl
#+begin_src tmux
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl

sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
#+end_src



For working with google cloud platform we use the [[https://cloud.google.com/sdk/][GCP SDK]], which provides our cli tools.

#+NAME: Install google cloud sdk
#+BEGIN_src tmux
# Download the sdk archive
curl -o gcpsdk.tar -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-sdk-375.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

# Extract to a folder in path then remove archive
sudo tar xvf gcpsdk.tar -C /usr/local/ && rm gcpsdk.tar

# Correct folder permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /usr/local/google-cloud-sdk

# Run the install script
/usr/local/google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: Install google cloud sdk
#+begin_example
#+end_example


For working with [[https://aws.com][Amazon Web Services]] we need the [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html][AWS CLI]].

#+NAME: Install amazon web services cli
#+BEGIN_src tmux
# Download the binary
cd ~/Downloads/
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"

# Install
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

# Clean up
rm -rf ~/Downloads/aws*
#+END_SRC


** Optional - Nodejs dev tooling

Some of my project work involves working with [[https://nodejs.org/en][nodejs]] and for package management namely we sometimes use [[https://www.npmjs.com/][node package manager]]. The code below installs node ~16.x~, which is the latest stable release as of <2022-09-16 Fri>.

#+NAME: Install nodejs
#+BEGIN_src tmux
# Curl down the shell script for adding version 16 of nodejs to apt
sudo curl  -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -

# Install the nodejs package via apt
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install yarn dependency manager
sudo npm install --global yarn
#+END_SRC


** Optional - Install hardware drivers


** Optional - Setup humacs editor

An integral part of our pair development workflow is [[https://github.com/humacs/humacs][humacs]]. Below are the instructions to set this up.

#+NAME: Install and configure humacs
#+BEGIN_src tmux
# Clone down humacs
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jmhbnz/humacs /home/$USER/Downloads/

# Need to ensure environment variables are set for load path
export EMACSLOADPATH=/home/$USER/Downloads/humacs
#+END_SRC

Included in this repository is a ~.bashrc~ and ~humacs-custom.el~ which layer my personal preferences on top of humacs.


** Optional - Setup sbp powerline prompt

Having an informative bash prompt can ease cognitive burden and make development more pleasant. Below is an example of my terminal prompt which is based on [[https://github.com/powerline/fonts/][powerline fonts]] for symbols and [[https://github.com/brujoand/sbp][simple bash prompt]] for the overall presentation.

As you can see in the screenshot, contextual "segments" are presented in the prompt to provide information like directory, current user and detailed git status.

[[./images/powerline-prompt.png]]


To set up this prompt the first thing we need to do is install powerline fonts:

#+NAME: Install powerline fonts
#+begin_src tmux
# Install the powerline fonts package
sudo apt-get install fonts-powerline

# Refresh the system font cache
sudo fc-cache --force --verbose
#+end_src


Once powerline fonts are installed we need to install simple bash prompt:

#+NAME: Install simple bash prompt
#+begin_src tmux
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jmhbnz/sbp ~/Downloads/sbp/

# Run the install script
/home/$USER/Downloads/sbp/bin/install

# Ensure config directory exists
mkdir --parents /home/$USER/.config/sbp/

# Write the config file
cat << EOF >
#!/usr/bin/env bash
SBP_THEME_COLOR='apathy'
SBP_THEME_LAYOUT='powerline'

# Hooks will run once before every prompt
# Run 'sbp list hooks' to list all available hooks
SBP_HOOKS=('alert')

# Segments are generated before each prompt and can
# be added, removed and reordered
# Run 'sbp list segments' to list all available segments
# Maybe you don't want to run all segments when in
# a small window?

if [[ "$COLUMNS" -le 120 ]]; then
  # Let's adjust to the smaller screen
  SBP_THEME_LAYOUT='powerline'
  SBP_SEGMENTS_LEFT=('path' 'python_env' 'git' 'command')
else
  SBP_SEGMENTS_LEFT=('host' 'path' 'python_env' 'k8s' 'git' 'nix')
  SBP_SEGMENTS_RIGHT=('command' 'timestamp')
  SBP_SEGMENTS_LINE_TWO=('prompt_ready')
fi

# Segment specific settings
SEGMENTS_K8S_DEFAULT_USER="$USER"
SEGMENTS_K8S_HIDE_CLUSTER=1
SEGMENTS_LOAD_THRESHOLD=50
SEGMENTS_LOAD_THRESHOLD_HIGH=80
SEGMENTS_RESCUETIME_REFRESH_RATE=600
SEGMENTS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT="%H:%M:%S"
SEGMENTS_WTTR_LOCATION='Oslo'
SEGMENTS_WTTR_FORMAT='%p;%t;%w'
EOF

# Reload the prompt
sbp reload

# Disable the k8s segment (it's a bit too long when working with openshift)
sbp toggle peekaboo k8s
#+end_src

Congratulations - you should now have a functional, good looking and informative bash prompt! 🎉


** Optional - Setup mutt mail client

For reading email we ideally use a cli based client for fast searching and lightweight mail reading.

The [[https://gitlab.com/muttmua/mutt/][mutt]] mail client fills these roles well for imap mailboxes.

The first step to setup mutt is to ensure it is installed.

#+NAME: Install mutt
#+BEGIN_src tmux
sudo apt-get install -y mutt urlscan
#+END_SRC

After installing mutt we then need to create configuration directories and files.

#+NAME: Create mutt config files
#+BEGIN_src tmux
mkdir -p ~/.mutt/cache/headers
mkdir ~/.mutt/cache/bodies
touch ~/.mutt/certificates
#+END_SRC

One configuration folders and files exist we just need to populate our user mutt configuration file with a configuration for our particular mail provider.

The example provided in this repository utilises the ~bitwarden~ cli utility for secrets to ensure these are securely gathered at runtime and not stored in the file.


** Optional - Rust dev tooling

I've been tinkering with learning the [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] programming language lately, to set that up follow these steps:

#+NAME: Install pre-requisites
#+begin_src tmux
# Ensure pre-requisites are installed
sudo apt install curl build-essential gcc make -y
#+end_src

#+NAME: Install rust via helper script
#+begin_src tmux
# Install rust via helper script
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
#+end_src

Once installed you can check if the rust compiler is installed with the code block below:

#+NAME: Verify installation
#+begin_src tmux
rustc -V && cargo -V
#+end_src
