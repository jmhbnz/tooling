This guide will walk through how I setup fresh installations of [[https://linuxmint.com/][Linux Mint]]. Linux Mint is an operating system for desktop and laptop computers. It is designed to work 'out of the box' and comes fully equipped with the apps most people need.

I use Linux Mint as my daily driver operating system on a variety of different machines. The intent of this guide is to make it easy for me to get back up and running quickly whenver I do a fresh installation.
